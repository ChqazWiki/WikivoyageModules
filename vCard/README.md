----
In 2023, we Japanese community decided to replace Listing templates to vCard, which is a new version that is fully compatible. You can see the local discussion at the [project chat](https://w.wiki/89x5), and here is the code storage of files of vCard and related ones. This also includes modules' documentation pages and some of JavaScript linked to vCard.

## Progress
There are many tasks, such as translations, localizations, and so on. The tree showing the progress is below:

- [ ] core
  - [ ] [vCard/Cards](core/Cards.lua)
- [ ] Marker

## Lisence
All modules in this storage are from German Wikivoyage, and these all are imported and edited under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).
